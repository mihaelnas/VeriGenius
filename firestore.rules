/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for the University System.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for student profiles, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and modify their own data. Class data is publicly readable but writable only with appropriate authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores individual student profiles. The {studentId} must match the authenticated user's UID for ownership.
 * - /classes/{classId}: Stores information about each class.  It includes an array of studentIds.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only create, read, update, and delete their own profiles.
 * - Listing all students is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Class data is publicly readable to facilitate discovery, but write access is restricted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The /classes/{classId} documents contain a `studentIds` array, `level` and `fieldOfStudy` to determine class enrollment.

     * @deny (create) - An unauthenticated user cannot create a student profile.
     * @deny (update) - An authenticated user cannot update another user's profile.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for writes and restricts access to a user's own data.
